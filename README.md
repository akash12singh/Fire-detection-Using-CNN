# Fire-detection-Using-CNN
Early detection of fire is crucial as they might turn into fatal event which may result into loss of many innocent lives.
It not only impact in the physical but also in the social and economic context on the occurred position.
â€”Fire disasters are man-made disasters, which cause ecological, social, and economical damages. To 
minimize these losses, early detection of fire and an autonomous response is important and helpful to disaster 
management systems. Therefore, in this article, we propose an early fire detection framework using fine-tuned 
convolutional neural networks for CCTV surveillance cameras, which can detect fire in varying indoor and 
outdoor environments. To ensure the autonomous response, we propose an adaptive prioritization mechanism for 
cameras in the surveillance system.
